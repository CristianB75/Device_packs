The 'Blinky' project is a simple application example for
Microchip 'ATSAML10E16A' microcontroller using Microchip 'SAML10-XPRO' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =    OSC8M
   - CPU Clock  =    4 MHz

 - 1 LED blinks with a fixed speed.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAML10 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
